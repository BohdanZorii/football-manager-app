# Football Manager

### Project Setup
1. Ensure that **Docker** is installed and running on your machine.
2. Clone the project from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BohdanZorii/football-manager-app.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd football-manager-app
   ```
4. Build and start the containers using Docker Compose:
   ```
